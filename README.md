<h3>Breast Cancer Prediction: Logisitc Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vecotor Machine and Neural Nets</h3>
<p>This script compares five machine learning models and their accuracy on prediction of breast cancer data found here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Prognostic%29</p>
<p>The script checkes for NA values and correlations. It then uses 5 machine learning models: Logisitc Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vecotor Machine and Neural Nets. The accuracy of each model is compared in a table at the end of the script</p>

<h3>Titanic Survival: Logistic Regression, Random Forest</h3>
his script is an introduction to R machine learning. It aims to predict if a person will survive based on where they embarked, the cabin, fare, number of parents and children, number of siblines, the age of the passenger, sex of passenger and ticket class</p>
<p>The feature cabin was engineered into 'known' and 'unknown'. The feature name was engineered into: 'Mr', 'Ms', 'Rev' and 'Titled Men'. The feature age contained several blanks. This data was inferred using the average age for each class.</p>
<p>Logisitc Regression as well as Random Forest were used to pridict survival.</p>
